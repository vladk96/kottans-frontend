## Theoretical tasks
## Git Basics

I have already known basic commands of Git, but I still passed this course again. I also completed the course [Learn Git Branches](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
In this course I learned a new command 'Cherry-pick' and other tricks with git branches. So, each course was interesting and useful. Thanks a lot.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

In this task I passed course about command line. This topic was not new for me. I have known the basic commands and I used them before, but I did not know about 'Bash scripting'.
I also read two articles about protocol HTTP.
